# Python-Turtle-Printer
This was done as a case study to learn really basic image manipulation and pixel recognition. It uses Open-Cv2 and Turtle modules, the first to import the images and get it to a black and white state, and the latter to "print" it.


First, I need to address the problems with this code. It's dead slow.
To get the image to gray scale and then black and white it's fast, but when the turtle does it job...

For reference, it took 2 minutes to print the "Great Wave off Kanagawa" at 100x100.
Then I did the same image at 468x300, and it did in... ... ... 34 minutes. Well, at least it's pretty?
